iCommands is a command-line interface for iRODS, the open-source
software behind Tier-1 Data. For those who are familiar with Unix command-line
programs, it is a powerful and easy to use tool.

************
Installation
************

iCommands are currently installed on **all HPC clusters of the VSC.**   

You can of course also install iCommands on your local system. 
However, iCommands is only available for Linux environments. 
To get one, Windows users might consider installing :ref:`Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)<wsl>`.

You can install iCommands on different distributions as follows:

Centos 7:
=========

.. code-block:: sh

   # Installing prerequisites
   yum update
   yum install wget sudo

   # Add the iRODS repository to your package manager (if you haven't done so already)
   sudo rpm --import https://packages.irods.org/irods-signing-key.asc
   wget -qO - https://packages.irods.org/renci-irods.yum.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/renci-irods.yum.repo

   # Installing iCommands  
   yum install irods-icommands

**************
Authenticating
**************

To authenticate, go to the `ManGO portal <https://mango.vscentrum.be>`__
and log in. Click on ‘How to connect’ next to your zone, copy the code
under ‘iCommands for Linux’ and paste it into your terminal. This should
authenticate your for 168 hours.

Alternatively, you can use one of the following commands to log in: 

- On HPC clusters of the KU Leuven, use the command ``irods-setup --zone <zone> | bash``.  
  This command can also be used at the beginning of your job script to authenticate.
  This is especially recommended for long running jobs, since if they spend a lot of time in the queue and a long time running, this may exceed the standard 7 day authentication.  

- On other HPC clusters in Flanders, you can log in with ``ssh login.hpc.kuleuven.be irods-setup --zone <zone> | bash``.  
  This command can currently not be included in job scripts, since it requires interaction from the user.  

For most users, the ``<zone>`` will be the default zone 'vsc'.

************
Getting help
************

iCommands has a built-in documentation, which you can access from the
command line. The command ``ihelp`` gives an overview of all commands,
with a brief description.

To get the documentation for a specific command, you can either type
``ihelp <command>`` or ``command -h``.

*******************************
Similarities with UNIX commands
*******************************

To people who are used to working on a Linux command line, iCommands
will instantly feel familiar. Many unix commands have a direct Unix
counterpart. While the Unix commands work on the local workspace, the
iCommands work on the data in Tier-1 Data.

+-------------------------------+-----------------------+-------------+

Just like Unix commands, iCommands work with both absolute and relative
paths. For example, to go from ``/<zone>/home/<project>`` to
``/<zone>/home/<project>/raw_data`` you can use both of the following
options:

.. code-block:: sh

   icd raw_data

   icd /<zone>/home/<project>/raw_data

Like with Unix commands, you can use ``.`` to refer to the current
working collection, and ``..`` to refer to one level above the current
collection.

An important difference is that iCommands have no shell expansion. If
you try to use autocompletion with iCommands, or use wildcards (*), it
will be filled in based on the data in your local directory. This can
yield unexpected results.

*************************
Uploading and downloading
*************************

To upload data from your local directory to Tier-1 Data, you can use the
command ``iput``. You can upload individual files but also whole
directories, by using the ``-r`` option, which stands for ‘recursive’.

.. code-block:: sh

   iput <filename>
   iput -r  <directory>

You can optionally specify a destination as second argument. If you
leave the destination blank, iput will take the current working
collection as destination by default.

To download data objects or whole collections from Tier-1 Data to your local
directory, you can use the command ``iget``:

.. code-block:: sh

   iget <data_object>
   iget -r <collection>

``iget`` downloads data to your current working directory, unless you
specify another destination as second argument.

It is also possible with iCommands to sync a local directory and a
collection in Tier-1 Data with the command ``irsync``. This command makes a
comparison between the data on both sides. Any data from the source
which is missing in the destination, is transferred. If files are
present in both the source and destination, ``irsync`` will calculate
checksums to see whether the version in the destination is still up to
date.

.. code-block:: sh

   # syncronizing data from a local directory to a Tier-1 Data collection
   irsync -r <directory> i:<collection>

   # syncronizing data from a Tier-1 Data collection to a local directory
   irsync -r i:<collection> <directory>

***********
Permissions
***********

The command ``ichmod`` can be used to give groups or users :ref:`permissions and inheritance<collaboration>` on objects.

You can give a group or user access on an object as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   ichmod <read/write/own> <group/user> <object_path>

You can remove the access of a group or user on an object by giving them 'null' access:

.. code-block:: sh

   ichmod null <group/user> <object_path>

When giving or removing access to a collection, you can use the ``-r`` flag to apply the permissions recursively.
That way, they are applied to all contents of the collection:

.. code-block:: sh

   ichmod -r <read/write/own> <group/user> <collection_path>

The command can be used to change the inheritance property of a collection as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   # changing inheritance for one collection
   ichmod <inherit/noinherit> <collection_path>

   # changing inheritance recursively
   ichmod -r <inherit/noinherit> <collection_path>

********
Metadata
********

The command ``imeta`` can be used to add, list, manipulate and remove :ref:`metadata<metadata>` on data objects and collections.

You can add any AVU to a data object as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   imeta add -d <filename> <attribute> <value> <units>

As always, the units are optional.

The flag '-d' is necessary, and indicates the operation is applied to a data object.
For collections, the flag needed is '-C'.

The following command can also be used to add a new AVU to an object.
The difference with ``imeta add`` is that it will overwrite if there is an AVU with the same attribute but a different value (and units).

.. code-block:: sh

   imeta set -d <filename> <attribute> <value> <units>

You can list the metadata on an object as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   imeta ls -d <filename>

Lastly, you can remove a specific AVU as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   imeta rm -d <filename> <attribute> <value> <units>

imeta also has other options, which you can discover by using ``imeta -h``.
