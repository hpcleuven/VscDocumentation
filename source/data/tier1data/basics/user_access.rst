User Access to Tier-1 Data
##########################

If your research group is interested in using Tier-1 Data, you need to request a Tier-1 Data project.
This is done by submitting a project application before one of the cut-off dates each year. 
Importantly, each collaborator should have a VSC-account. 

For more information on this procedure, see https://www.vscentrum.be/data. 

Users can connect to Tier-1 Data by using different clients from any computer after logging in with their institutional account.
For example, VSC users from UAntwerpen will be forwarded to the UAntwerpen login page.

The landing page for all Tier-1 Data clients is our web front-end, the `ManGO portal <https://mango.vscentrum.be/>`_.  
After logging in, you will get an overview of all zones you have access to.  
By clicking on 'Enter portal', you will go to the ManGO portal for that zone.
If you prefer to access Tier-1 Data via a different client, you can find the necessary credentials or code under 'How to Connect'.

For :ref:`iCommands`, you need a Linux client environment on a linux based operation system (Linux distros or :ref:`wsl`)
with iCommands installed.
This client has been installed on most of our HPC systems.

For :ref:`the Python programming client (PRC) <python-client>`, you need at least an installed Python release and the PRC itself.
This suffices for a connection with the default password duration of 60 hours. 
However, it is also possible to log in with a password of long duration (7 days) if you also have a Linux client environment
with iCommands installed.


For more information on how to install and use each client, see the `clients <../clients.html>`_ section. 

Once logged in, Tier-1 Data users can find their group folder at ``/<zone-name>/home/<project-name>``.
This area is shared with and visible to all members of your group, but can be further subdivided in subfolders
with more specific permissions.
