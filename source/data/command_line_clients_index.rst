Command line Access
===================

It's possible to access an iRODS Zone via command line software that support the WebDAV protocol. WebDAV stands for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, which is an extension to HTTP, the protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other.
WebDAV can be used for remotely managing files over the internet. With WebDAV, we can access files stored in the VSC Tier-1 Data component by using the same interface as we do with our local files.
