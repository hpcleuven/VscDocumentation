Files
=====

The 'Files' menu provides a file explorer that allows you to navigate through
your files and folders. General file explorer options like moving, deleting,
modifying and creating files or directories are available as well.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: KU Leuven/UHasselt
      :sync: kuluh

      From the 'Files' menu, you can access your ``$VSC_HOME`` and ``$VSC_DATA``
      folders.

   .. tab-item:: VUB
      :sync: vub

      From the 'Files' menu, you can access all ``$VSC_*`` folders available to
      you.

Download/upload
---------------

You can also use the Files interface to download and upload to and from
your local machine. Be aware that this is not recommended for very large files.

For large files we recommend the :ref:`globus platform`.  The ``Globus`` button
takes you directly to the Globus login page, and upon a successful login to your
Globus account (using your institution credentials), you will land on the same
sub-directory from which you clicked on the Globus button.

File editing
------------

You can edit a file via the button with 3 vertical dots and a down arrow on the
right side of the file.

.. tip:: The standard ``ctrl+s`` keyboard shortcut does **not** save your edited
   files on the web portal, but will trigger a save on your local machine.
   Luckily, there is a ``Save`` button in the upper left corner of the editor
   page.
