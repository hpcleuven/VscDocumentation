.. _Python packages:

Python package management
=========================

Introduction
------------

Python comes with an extensive standard library, and you are strongly
encouraged to use those packages as much as possible, since this will
ensure that your code can be run on any platform that supports Python.


However, many useful extensions to and libraries for Python come in the form of
packages that can be installed separately. Many Python packages have been made
available through the module system, but must be loaded explicitly.

Given the astounding number of packages, it is not sustainable to install each
and every one system wide. Since it is relatively easy for a user to install
them just for themselves, or for their research group, that is not a problem
though. Do not hesitate to contact support whenever you encounter trouble doing
so.

Checking for installed packages
-------------------------------

To check which Python packages are installed, the ``pip`` utility is
useful. It will list all packages that are installed for the Python
distribution you are using, including those installed by you, i.e.,
in your account.

#. Load the module for the Python version you wish to use, e.g.,::

      $ module load Python/3.11.3-GCCcore-12.3.0

#. Run ``pip``::

      $ pip list -v

Note that many packages, e.g., ``mpi4py``, ``h5py``, ``pytables``,..., are
available through the module system, and have to be loaded separately. These
packages will not be listed by ``pip`` unless you loaded the corresponding
module.  In recent toolchains, many of the packages you need for scientific
computing have been bundled into the ``SciPy-bundle`` module.

.. _venv_python:

Python virtual environments
---------------------------

A `Python virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_
is an isolated environment in which you can safely install Python packages,
independent from those installed in the system or in other virtual environments.
For example, using virtual environments is very convenient for Python developers
as it allows working on multiple software projects at the same time.

It is recommended to use the software modules already installed in the cluster
as much as possible. They provide a robust and performant base to build your
virtual environments.

In this section, we show how you can combine modules with virtual environments
in the HPC to get the best of two worlds.

#. |Warning| Virtual environments are closely linked to the :ref:`CPU
   microarchitecture <tier2 hardware>` of the node on which they were created.
   This is especially important for heterogeneous clusters, where architecture
   may differ across login nodes and cluster partitions.  To get the
   architecture of the current node, you can use the ``$VSC_ARCH_LOCAL``
   environment variable.

   Start by launching an :ref:`interactive shell <interactive jobs>` in the
   :ref:`cluster partition<slurm_partition>` of choice, for example in the
   *zen4* partition:

   .. code-block:: shell

      srun --partition=zen4 --pty bash -l

#. Load a Python module as base of the virtual environment. Choose a Python
   version that is suitable for the additional Python packages that will be
   installed in the virtual environment:

   .. code-block:: shell

      module load Python/3.11.3-GCCcore-12.3.0

#. |Optional| Load other modules with additional Python packages:

   .. code-block:: shell

      module load SciPy-bundle/2023.07-gfbf-2023a

   The *Python* software modules in the HPC include a very limited list of
   Python packages, but many other modules are also available. A common
   software module is ``SciPy-bundle``, a bundle of data science packages such
   as ``numpy``, ``pandas``, and ``scipy``.

#. Create your virtual environment.

   |Warning| Avoid making your virtual environments in your home directory. The
   :ref:`storage space of your home <storage hardware>` is very small and can
   quickly become filled up with installation files. Use a folder in your
   personal ``$VSC_SCRATCH`` or ``$VSC_DATA`` storage; or in your VO if you are
   part of one.

   This example code block creates a new virtual environment in the
   *venv-zen4* directory:

   .. code-block:: shell

      python3 -m venv venv-zen4 --system-site-packages

   Option ``--system-site-packages`` ensures using the Python packages already
   available via the loaded modules instead of installing them in the virtual
   environment.

#. Before we can use the virtual environment, we must `activate` it:

   .. code-block:: shell

      source venv-zen4/bin/activate

   Once the virtual environment is active, its name will be displayed in front
   of the shell prompt (``(venv-zen4)`` in this example). Make sure to keep this
   virtual environment activated when executing the following steps.

#. We recommend to always upgrade ``pip`` to the latest version:

   .. code-block:: shell

      (venv-zen4) $ python3 -m pip install pip --upgrade

#. Now we can install additional Python packages inside the active virtual
   environment, for example the *icecream* package:

   .. code-block:: shell

      (venv-zen4) $ python3 -m pip install icecream --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation

   Option ``--no-cache-dir`` ensures installing the most recent compatible
   versions of the dependencies, ignoring the versions available in your cache.

   Option ``--no-build-isolation`` ensures using the Cython compiler and other
   (build) dependencies from loaded modules instead of building in an isolated
   environment.

#. Once your work is finished, use the command ``deactivate`` to deactivate your
   virtual environment:

   .. code-block:: shell

      (venv-zen4) $ deactivate

Reactivating your virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever you want to go back to any of your virtual environments make sure to:

#. Launch an interactive job in the same partition you used when creating the
   virtual environment (or add the sbatch ``--partition`` option to your job
   script)::

    srun --partition=zen4 --pty bash -l

#. Load the same software modules that you used in the creation of the virtual
   environment::

    module load Python/3.11.3-GCCcore-12.3.0 SciPy-bundle/2023.07-gfbf-2023a

#. Reactivate the virtual environment::

    venv-zen4/bin/activate

.. _conda for Python:

Install Python packages using conda
-----------------------------------

.. note::

    Conda packages are incompatible with the software modules.
    Usage of conda is discouraged in the clusters at UAntwerpen, UGent,
    and VUB.

The easiest way to install and manage your own Python environment is
conda.  Using conda has some major advantages.

-  You can create project-specific environments that can be shared with
   others and (up to a point) across platforms.  This makes it easier to
   ensure that your experiments are reproducible.
-  conda takes care of the dependencies, up to the level of system libraries.
   This makes it very easy to install packages.

However, this last advantage is also a potential drawback: you have to
review the libraries that conda installs because they may not have
been optimized for the hardware you are using.  For linear algebra, conda
will typically use Intel MKL runtime libraries, giving you performance that
is on par with the Python modules for `numpy` and `scipy`.

However, care has to be taken in a number of situations.  When you require
``mpi4py``, conda will typically use a library that is not configured and
optimized for the networks used in our clusters, and the performance impact
is quite severe.  Another example is TensorFlow when running on CPUs, the
default package is not optimized for the CPUs in our infrastructure, and will
run sub-optimally.  (Note that this is not the case when you run TensorFlow on
GPUs, since conda will install the appropriate CUDA libraries.)

These issues can be avoided by using the `Intel oneAPI Python Distribution`_
that contains `Intel MPI`_ and optimized versions of packages such as
scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

.. _install_miniconda_python:

Install Miniconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have Miniconda already installed, you can skip ahead to the next
section, if Miniconda is not installed, we start with that. Download the
Bash script that will install it from `conda.io <https://conda.io/>`_
using, e.g., ``wget``::

   $ wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

Once downloaded, run the installation script::

   $ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $VSC_DATA/miniconda3

.. warning::

   It is important to use ``$VSC_DATA`` to store your conda installation
   since environments tend to be large, and your quota in ``$VSC_HOME``
   would be exceeded soon.

Optionally, you can add the path to the Miniconda installation to the
``PATH`` environment variable in your ``.bashrc`` file. This is convenient, but
may lead to conflicts when working with the module system, so make sure
that you know what you are doing in either case. The line to add to your
``.bashrc`` file would be::

   export PATH="${VSC_DATA}/miniconda3/bin:${PATH}"

.. _create_python_conda_env:

Create an environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, ensure that the Miniconda installation is in your PATH
environment variable. The following command should return the full path
to the conda command::

   $ which conda

If the result is blank, or reports that conda can not be found, modify
the ``PATH`` environment variable appropriately by adding Miniconda's ``bin``
directory to ``PATH``.

You can create an environment based on the default conda channels, but
it is recommended to at least consider the Intel Python distribution.

Intel provides instructions on how to install the `Intel oneAPI Python
Distribution`_ with conda.

Alternatively, you can create a new conda environment based on the default
channels::

   $ conda create  -n science  numpy scipy matplotlib

This command creates a new conda environment called science, and
installs a number of Python packages that you will probably want to have
handy in any case to preprocess, visualize, or postprocess your data.
You can of course install more, depending on your requirements and
personal taste.

This will default to the latest Python 3 version, if you need a specific
version, e.g., Python 2.7.x, this can be specified as follows::

   $ conda create -n science  python=2.7  numpy scipy matplotlib


Work with the environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To work with an environment, you have to activate it. This is done with,
e.g.,

::

   $ source activate science

Here, ``science`` is the name of the environment you want to work in.


Install an additional package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install an additional package, e.g., \`pandas`, first ensure that the
environment you want to work in is activated.

::

   $ source activate science

Next, install the package::

   $ conda install tensorflow-gpu

Note that conda will take care of all dependencies, including
non-Python libraries (e.g., cuDNN and CUDA for the example above). This
ensures that you work in a consistent environment.


Update/remove a package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using conda, it is easy to keep your packages up-to-date. Updating a
single package (and its dependencies) can be done using::

   $ conda update pandas

Updating all packages in the environment is trivial::

   $ conda update --all

Removing an installed package::

   $ conda remove tensorflow-gpu


Deactivate an environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To deactivate a conda environment, i.e., return the shell to its
original state, use the following command::

   $ source deactivate

Additional information about conda can be found on its `documentation
site <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_.

Installing Anaconda on NX node (KU Leuven Genius)
-------------------------------------------------

#. Before installing make sure that you do not have a ``.local/lib``
   directory in your ``$VSC_HOME``. In case it exists, please move it to
   some other location or temporary archive. It creates conflicts with
   Anaconda.
#. Download appropriate (64-Bit (x86) Linux Installer) version of Anaconda
   from `https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads>`_
#. Change the permissions of the file (if necessary)::

      $ chmod u+x Anaconda3-2019.07-Linux-x86_64.sh

#. Execute the installer::
  
      $ ./Anaconda3-2019.07-Linux-x86_64.sh 

   You will be asked for to accept the license agreement, choose the location where
   it should be installed (please choose your ``$VSC_DATA``). After installation is
   done you can choose to installer to add the Anaconda path to your ``.bashrc``.
   We recommend not to do that as it will prevent creating NX desktops. Instead of
   that you can manually (or in another script) modify your path when you want to
   use Anaconda::

      export PATH="${VSC_DATA}/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

#. Go to the directory where Anaconda is installed and check for updates, e.g.,::

      $ cd anaconda3/bin/
      $ conda update anaconda-navigator

#. You can start the navigator from that directory with::

      $ ./anaconda-navigator
