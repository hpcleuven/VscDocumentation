:fas:`user-circle` Accounts and access
######################################

In order to use the infrastructure of the VSC, you need a VSC user-ID,
also called a VSC account. Check the `VSC website <eligible users>`_
for conditions.

All VSC-accounts start with the letters ``vsc`` followed by a
five-digit number. The first digit gives information about your home
institution. There is no relationship with your name, nor is the
information about the link between VSC-accounts and your name publicly
accessible.

Your VSC account gives you access to most of the VSC Tier-2 infrastructure,
though for some more specialized hardware you may have to ask access separately.
The rationale is that  we want to ensure that that specialized (usually rather
expensive) hardware is used efficiently for the type of applications it was
purchased for.  Contact your `local VSC coordinator <get in touch>`_ to arrange
access when required.

For the main Tier-1 compute cluster you need to submit a
`project application <tier-1 project application>`_ (or you should be
covered by a project application within your research group).

Before you apply for VSC account, it is useful to first check whether
the infrastructure is suitable for your application. Windows or macOS
programs for instance cannot run on our infrastructure as we use the
Linux operating system on the clusters. The infrastructure also should
not be used to run applications for which the compute power of a good
laptop is sufficient. The pages on the :ref:`tier1 hardware` and
:ref:`tier2 hardware` give a high-level description of our
infrastructure. You can find more detailed information in the user
documentation on the user portal. When in doubt, you can also contact
your `local support team <get in touch>`_. This does not require a VSC account.
