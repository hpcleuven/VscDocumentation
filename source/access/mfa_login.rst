Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
=================================

|KUL| Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) is an augmented level of security which, as
the name suggests, requires multiple steps when authenticating. This document provides
two methods to connect to the KU Leuven clusters with
MFA. The first method, *without* an agent, is easier to get started with, but requires
some repetitive steps with each connection. The second method, *with* an agent,
requires some more effort to set up initially but will be easier when you need
multiple connections or you are using some specific GUI applications to connect.
