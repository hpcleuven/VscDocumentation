:fas:`key` Authentication
#########################

Connections to VSC clusters are always encrypted to secure your data.
Depending on the destination VSC site that you are going to login to,
and based on your affiliation to one of the major flemish universities,
you either need a cryptographic key pair (for UAntwerpen, UGent and VUB),
or you need to go through multi-factor authentication (for KU Leuven).

If you are accessing the VSC clusters from abroad, you need to first
authenticate yourself via the `VSC firewall page <https://firewall.vscentrum.be>`_.

Below, we elaborate further how to authenticate yourself depending on your
institute affiliation and your target VSC site.

|KUL| Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) is an augmented level of security
which, as the name suggests, requires multiple steps to successfully
authenticate. This method is necessary to connect to the KU Leuven clusters.
