Using MATLAB and R
======================================

Some programming languages have an extensive standard library, and
additionally allow to install extra packages. For most languages, the
user can install packages in his own home directory without system
administrator intervention. Some documentation for doing this for
:ref:`Perl <Perl packages>` and :ref:`Python <Python packages>` is 
provided.

MATLAB and R are two of such programming languages, where we would
like to introduce some of their specific features.
