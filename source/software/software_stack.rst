Programming Languages
---------------------

Some programming languages have an extensive standard library, but
optionally allow to install extra packages. For most languages, the
user can install packages in his own home directory without system
administrator intervention. Some documentation for doing this for
:ref:`Perl <Perl packages>` and :ref:`Python <Python packages>` is provided.
