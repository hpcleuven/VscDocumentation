BrENIAC login infrastructure
----------------------------

.. note::

   BrENIAC was the VSC Tier-1 cluster hosted at KU Leuven, which was
   decommissioned in 2018. This page is only for any possible future reference.

Direct login using SSH was possible to two regular login nodes and an NX login
node with an NVIDIA Quadro GPU.
