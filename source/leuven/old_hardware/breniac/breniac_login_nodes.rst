BrENIAC login infrastructure
----------------------------

.. note::

   BrENIAC was the second VSC Tier-1 cluster, which was hosted at KU Leuven
   and operated between 2016 and 2022. This page is only for any possible
   future reference.

Direct login using SSH was possible to two regular login nodes and an NX login
node with an NVIDIA Quadro GPU.
