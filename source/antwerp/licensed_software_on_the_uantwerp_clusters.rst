.. _licensed software UAntwerp:

Licensed software on the UAntwerp clusters
==========================================

Several of the software packages running on the UAntwerp cluster have
restrictions in their licenses and cannot be used by all users. If a
module does not load, it is very likely that you have no access to the
package.

Access to such packages is managed by UNIX groups. You can request
membership to the group, but that membership will only be granted if you
are eligible for use of the package.

AMBER
-----

Amber is licensed software (through a site license). The license fee is minimal
for non-profit work but comes at a considerable cost for for-profit research. In
case of use for a third party that third party needs to have a license too.

Contact `Hans De Winter <https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/hans-dewinter/>`_
for more information on the conditions to use the license.

ANSYS

CPMD
----

`CPMD`_ can be used for free for
non-commercial research in education institutions under the `CPMD Free
License <https://www.cpmd.org/wordpress/index.php/download/apply-for-a-license/>`_.

To get access:

-  `Fill in the form for downloading
   CPMD <https://www.cpmd.org/wordpress/index.php/download/apply-for-a-license/cpmd-license-application/>`_
   on the CPMD website.
-  You'll see a "Thank You" page confirming your submission. Somewhat
   later - it may take up to a week but usually it is quite fast -
   you'll receive a mail with download instructions. Please forward that
   mail to hpc@uantwerpen.be. We
   then have to check with IBM for confirmation.
-  Apply for membership of the acpmd group via the `VSC account page`_.
-  As soon as we have confirmation from IBM that your license
   application has been accepted, your membership application for acpmd
   will be granted and you will be able to use CPMD.

--------

To use Gaussian, you should work or study at the University of Antwerp

Maple

Mathematica
-----------


MATLAB
------

We do not encourage the use of MATLAB on the cluster as it is neither
designed for use of HPC (despite a number of toolboxes that support
parallel computing) nor efficient.

MATLAB on the UAntwerp clusters can be used by everybody who can legally
use MATLAB within the UAntwerp Campus Agreement with The MathWorks. You
should have access to the modules if you are eligible. If you cannot
load the MATLAB modules yet think you are allowed to use MATLAB under
the UAntwerp license, please :ref:`contact support <user support VSC>`.

MonolixSuite

NUMECA FINE/Marine
------------------

FINE/Marine is commercial CFD software from NUMECA International for
simulation of flow around ships etc. The license has been granted for
use of the Solar Boat Team as sponsoring from NUMECA and cannot be used
by others. The license has expired, so FINE/Marine though still installed
on Leibniz can no longer be used until a group renews the license.


NUMECA OMNIS/LB
---------------


Siemens Simcenter
-----------------


VASP
----

To use VASP, you should work or study at the University of Antwerp
and your research group should contribute to the cost of the license.
